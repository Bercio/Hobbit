####Hobbit

Hobbit is a sandbox simulation of a small growing town. The user can observe
it's growth and evolution and interfere with it in small but significant ways.

It sports an old-school CLI; The town life and growth will be observable
through statistical reports, dialogues with the inhabitants and *Maybe* an
ASCII-art rappresentation of the town.

The simulation can be launched as a background daemon, and the user can then
monitor the progress of the town at any time from the command line. Simulations
can be saved to then be resumed at a later date, and as many simulations as the
cpu supports can be launched at the same time.
